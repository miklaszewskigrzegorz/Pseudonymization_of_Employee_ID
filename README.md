Pseudonymization of Employee IDs as PESEL or SS

**Author:** Grzegorz MikÅ‚aszewski

Overview
This program, "Pseudonymization of Employee IDs as PESEL or SS," provides a solution for data privacy and pseudonymization. It allows you to generate anonymous Employee IDs based on either the Polish National Identification Number (PESEL), Social Security numbers (SS), or other different identification numbers. Additionally, it offers functionality to save and load these generated IDs to and from a database.

Features
Employee ID Generation
Generate 20-Character Codes: This program can create 20-character Employee IDs, ensuring the anonymity of individuals while maintaining data integrity.
Data Validation and Storage
Validate and Add PESEL: You can validate and store PESEL numbers (11 characters) in the database. The validation process ensures that the PESEL is correctly formatted and checksums match.
Validate and Add Different IDs: This program allows you to validate and store different identification numbers that may be shorter than 11 characters. These IDs can then be used to generate anonymous Employee IDs.
Import from Excel: You can import lists of PESEL numbers from an Excel file. The program checks each PESEL from Column B and updates Column C and D with relevant information, including whether the PESEL exists in the database.
Logging
Logging: The program logs various activities, including date, user, and additional details. These logs are saved to log files, providing an audit trail of program activities.
Getting Started
